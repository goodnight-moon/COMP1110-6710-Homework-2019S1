Within the `comp1110.homework.J04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `ShoeSize`, that will estimate your shoe size
by reading in your height (in meters) from the console,
multiplying by 5.0, rounding it to the nearest integer
([rounding half up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_up)), and printing the result. Test your
program using the `J04` test.

 Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
